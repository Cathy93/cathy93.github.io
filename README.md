AIM AND TARGET AUDIENCE
>>>>>>> origin/master

My aim when we first started this project was to create a website that truly reflected my personality. It was to be a one pager and it was to be fun, bright and interesting.

This meant when I began to look at websites for inspiration the ones that I most enjoyed were ones with more color, more interactive and had either cartoons, some animation or really nice bright images.

My target audience is two fold. Firstly I wanted to aim it to future employers. I know that what makes a great work environment is the people and as such I wanted to come across friendly with a sense of humor and not super uptight.

This means that the language used throughout the website is more casual and relaxed rather than formal and professional. This also allows to come across as more approachable and less intimidating.

The second target audience is for clients who require a freelancer. I wanted to use this website to showcase my ability's and skills.

I set out to do this website in only HTML and CSS as I really wanted to improve my skills and understand any limitations.

##Design and Build Process

On the very first day of this projects we began to design on figma. I found an amazing photo on unsplash that was exactly what I was looking for and became the center for my design.

As you can see my figma board I played with shapes like triangles as I really wanted design aspects to stand out.

As the weeks progressed though, I did find my self limited with the ways I could carry out my design in pure CSS. This meant that as the week progressed the design changed greatly from the initial wireframe.

All the colors used on the website are taken from the palette of the phot.

##Landing Page

This is the page I used the image from unsplash. Bright, bold and fun, this photo would set the tone for the rest of the website.

The font color is white as to contrast with the bright background and is sans-serif to be easy to read. The text is to introduce myself and to also allow people to get a quick insight straight away into who I am.

##About

My About page sets out to tell you something about myself. I used the background color to brighten up the website and to also highlight different areas of the website.

##My Latest Work

This is the area in which I will showcase my latest work. I used the screen shots of the actual projects as clickable links which can take the user to my GitHub area where they can then view the program in full. This is supposed to act as a teaser and draw the user into looking at my work.

##Skills.

Here I highlight my skills. Not only in web development but also everyday skills. I feel that whist having some coding skills is important, it is just as important to have some soft skills on offer. Pointing this out to potential employers may be the difference when compared to different applicants.

The background is blue, again to continue the them of the photo and to highlight the different section.

##Links

Lastly are the links. This provides a variety of avenue for people to contact me or to find out more about me.
